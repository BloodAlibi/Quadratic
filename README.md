# Quadratic
**Quadratic is a simple Python UI tool to solve quadratic equations.**
It takes the values of a, b and c, then returns the solutions for the equation ax²+bx+c.
It forbids the user to enter non-digit values and 0 for a.
It does not provide steps for now. It only returns the value of delta (Δ), and the solutions.
Please use this tool only as a verification for your results.

## Code inside
The Python program inside uses two librairies to work : math and tkinter (to generate the UI).
It has been compiled and turned into an exe. You can install it with the provided Installer, or use the raw version.

## How to use it
The program will take **three values : a, b and c.** You enter them in the corresponding boxes.

You can after press "Solve". Then, you'll see three answers :
- The delta (Δ)
- The solutions of the equation
  - x1 only, if Δ is equal to 0.
  - x1 and x2, if Δ is superior to 0.
  - None, if Δ is inferior to 0.

## How to download
You can download the Installer (exe) [here](https://github.com/BloodAlibi/Quadratic/tree/main/Quadratic/Installer_exe) to install it. If you wish to avoid Installers, you can still download the raw version (exe) with all its required files [here](https://github.com/BloodAlibi/Quadratic/tree/main/Quadratic/Original_exe).
You may also download the Python file and run it.
MacOS and Linux require the raw Python file.
